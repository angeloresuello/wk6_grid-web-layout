        <h2>Interesting Facts About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m going to begin about telling my musical background. I have a plenty of musical experiences, I can play guitar, ukulele, bass, drums and piano, but I’m not professional into all of them. I only know the basic in some of the instruments I mentioned. I’m also a motorcycle enthusiast, I find it really enjoyable on riding a motorcycle than driving a car. Cooking is another interest of mine, where I enjoy experimenting and learning with different recipes. I also like technology, which is related to my major, I find it interesting especially if there’s a latest gadget or advancement in technology comes out. Despite these various interests, I admit that I don’t enjoy public speaking because I don’t like being in front of many people and I also have a fear of heights. </p>
